3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner

### Required Files

Make sure your extension folder contains:

- `manifest.json`
- `src/background/background.js`
- `src/content/content.js`
- `src/popup/popup.html`
- `src/popup/popup.js`
- Icon files (16x16, 48x48, 128x128 pixels)

## Usage

### Method 1: Extension Popup (Recommended)

1. **Navigate to LinkedIn**: Open any LinkedIn feed page (home, company page, profile activity, etc.)
2. **Click Extension Icon**: Click the LinkedIn Post Saver icon in your Chrome toolbar
3. **Auto-Loading Process**: The extension will:
   - Start auto-scrolling to load all posts
   - Show real-time progress (e.g., "Loading posts... (47 found)")
   - Automatically click "Show more results" buttons
   - Continue until all posts are loaded
4. **Extraction & Download**: Once loading is complete, posts are extracted and downloaded
5. **Done!**: Your complete post collection is saved as a formatted markdown file

### Method 2: Right-Click Context Menu

1. **Navigate to LinkedIn**: Open any LinkedIn feed page
2. **Right-Click**: Right-click anywhere on the LinkedIn page
3. **Select "Save LinkedIn Posts (Auto-Scroll)"**: Click the context menu option
4. **Auto-Loading**: The extension automatically loads all posts in the background
5. **Notification**: You'll receive a notification when the process is complete
6. **Done!**: Posts are saved without opening the popup

> **‚è±Ô∏è Time Estimate**: The auto-scroll process typically takes 15-45 seconds depending on the number of posts available. Pages with hundreds of posts may take longer.

## Auto-Scroll Technology

### How It Works

1. **Progressive Scrolling**: The extension scrolls down the page in increments
2. **Load Detection**: Waits for new posts to load after each scroll
3. **Button Detection**: Searches for and clicks "Show more results" buttons automatically
4. **Completion Detection**: Stops when no new posts are found after multiple attempts
5. **Smart Waiting**: Adapts to LinkedIn's loading patterns and network speed

### Supported LinkedIn Pages

- ‚úÖ Home feed (`linkedin.com/feed/`)
- ‚úÖ Company pages (`linkedin.com/company/[name]/posts/`)
- ‚úÖ Profile activity (`linkedin.com/in/[username]/recent-activity/`)
- ‚úÖ Hashtag feeds (`linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/[tag]/`)
- ‚úÖ Search results (`linkedin.com/search/results/content/`)

### Loading Strategies

The extension uses multiple strategies to ensure complete post loading:

1. **Infinite Scroll Detection**: Monitors scroll position and document height
2. **Button Clicking**: Finds and clicks various "Show more" button types
3. **Loading Indicators**: Waits for LinkedIn's loading spinners to disappear
4. **Post Count Monitoring**: Tracks the number of posts before and after each action
5. **Timeout Protection**: Prevents infinite loops with reasonable time limits

## Output Format

The generated markdown file includes comprehensive information:

```markdown
# LinkedIn Posts Export

**Source:** [LinkedIn URL]
**Exported:** [Date]
**Total Posts:** [Number]

---

## Post 1

**Author:** [Author Name](Profile Link)
**Posted:** [Timestamp]
**Reactions:** [Count]
**Comments:** [Count]

[Post content with preserved formatting and links]

---

## Post 2

```

## Technical Details

### Permissions Required

- `activeTab`: Access to the current LinkedIn tab
- `downloads`: Download generated markdown files
- `scripting`: Inject content scripts into LinkedIn pages
- `contextMenus`: Add right-click context menu option
- `notifications`: Show completion notifications
- `host_permissions`: Access to LinkedIn.com

### Architecture

- **Content Script** (`content.js`):
  - Auto-scroll functionality
  - Post extraction from LinkedIn's DOM
  - Progress reporting
  - Button detection and clicking
- **Background Service Worker** (`background.js`):
  - File downloads
  - Context menu handling
  - Notification management
- **Popup Interface** (`popup.html/js`):
  - User interface for triggering extraction
  - Real-time progress display
  - Status updates

### Auto-Scroll Algorithm

```javascript
1. Count initial posts
2. Scroll down by viewport height
3. Wait for new content to load
4. Look for and click "Show more" buttons
5. Count posts again
6. If new posts found, repeat from step 2
7. If no new posts after 3 attempts, complete
8. Extract all loaded posts
```

### LinkedIn Post Structure

The extension targets posts within `.fie-impression-container` elements and extracts content from nested `<span dir="ltr">` elements, preserving:

- Text content with formatting
- Links to profiles and external URLs
- Line breaks and paragraph structure
- Author information and profile links
- Timestamps and relative dates
- Engagement metrics (reactions, comments)

## Troubleshooting

### Auto-Scroll Issues

1. **Slow Loading**: If posts load slowly, the extension will wait longer between scrolls
2. **Network Issues**: Poor internet connection may cause timeouts - try refreshing and retrying
3. **LinkedIn Changes**: If LinkedIn updates their structure, some posts might be missed

### Extension Not Working

1. **Check LinkedIn Page**: Make sure you're on a LinkedIn page with posts
2. **Refresh Page**: Try refreshing the LinkedIn page and try again
3. **Check Permissions**: Ensure the extension has permission to access LinkedIn
4. **Developer Console**: Check browser console for error messages

### Auto-Scroll Not Loading All Posts

1. **Try Manual Scroll**: Scroll down manually first, then use the extension
2. **Check Page Type**: Some LinkedIn pages have different loading mechanisms
3. **Network Speed**: Slow connections may need multiple attempts

### No Posts Found

1. **Wait for Page Load**: Ensure the LinkedIn page has fully loaded before using the extension
2. **Check Page Type**: Works best on feed pages, profile activity, company posts, etc.
3. **Login Status**: Make sure you're logged into LinkedIn

### Download Issues

1. **Pop-up Blockers**: Disable pop-up blockers for Chrome
2. **Download Settings**: Check Chrome's download settings
3. **Storage Space**: Ensure you have sufficient disk space

## Performance

### Optimization Features

- **Efficient DOM Querying**: Uses optimized selectors for fast post detection
- **Intelligent Waiting**: Adapts wait times based on content loading patterns
- **Memory Management**: Processes posts in batches to prevent memory issues
- **Progress Streaming**: Real-time updates without blocking the UI

### Typical Performance

- **Small feeds** (< 50 posts): 10-20 seconds
- **Medium feeds** (50-200 posts): 20-60 seconds
- **Large feeds** (200+ posts): 1-2 minutes
- **Very large feeds** (500+ posts): 2-3 minutes

## Limitations

- Auto-scroll speed is limited by LinkedIn's loading mechanisms
- Some embedded content (videos, images) may not be preserved in markdown
- Dependent on LinkedIn's HTML structure (may break with major site updates)
- Rate limiting: LinkedIn may temporarily slow down loading for very large feeds
- Private posts or restricted content will only be saved if you have access

## Privacy & Security

- **No Data Collection**: The extension doesn't collect or transmit any personal data
- **Local Processing**: All post extraction and auto-scrolling happens locally in your browser
- **No External Requests**: No data is sent to external servers during operation
- **File-Only Output**: Results are only saved to your local file system
- **Secure Processing**: All operations respect LinkedIn's security measures

## Development

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository
